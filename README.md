# -Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-Sales-from-Advertisement-Spending

## Overview

This is a machine learning project built using **Linear Regression** to predict product sales based on the advertisement spending on **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper**. The goal is to showcase how advertising budget allocation affects sales performance. I used the `advertising.csv` dataset to train a linear regression model and make predictions.

Additionally, I built an **interactive Streamlit app** that allows users to input their advertisement budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and get the predicted sales.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is the **Advertising Dataset**, which contains information about the advertising budget (TV, Radio, Newspaper) for a product, and the resulting **Sales**.
  
- Columns:
  - `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV.
  - `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on Radio.
  - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper.
  - `Sales`: Total sales as a result of advertising.

## Technologies

- **Python** (v3.8+)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` â€“ For data handling and processing
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ For building the Linear Regression model
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` â€“ For visualizing the data and model performance
  - `numpy` â€“ For mathematical operations
  - **Streamlit** â€“ For building the interactive app

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction-ml-project.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd sales-prediction-ml-project
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
    ```

4. Alternatively, run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/sales_prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Model Evaluation

- **Model used**: Linear Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
    - RÂ² Score: A measure of how well the model fits the data.
    - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error, to evaluate the model's prediction accuracy.

### Visualizations:
- **Regression Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between ad spending and sales.
- **Predicted vs Actual**: Compares the predicted sales with the actual sales for validation.

## Future Improvements

- Try other models such as **Ridge** or **Lasso** regression for comparison.
- Implement a **cross-validation** to improve model generalization.
- Use **interactive visualizations** to present results dynamically.
- ðŸ”§ 1. Experimenting with Advanced Models:

Exploring Ridge and Lasso Regression for better regularization.

Trying tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost to capture non-linear relationships.

Testing Neural Networks for even more complex predictions.

ðŸ”§ 2. Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation:

Implementing GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

Using K-fold Cross Validation for more reliable model performance estimates.

ðŸ”§ 3. Interactive Visualizations:

Adding dynamic, interactive visualizations in Streamlit to better understand how TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets impact sales.

Integrating Plotly for scatter plots, regression lines, and bar charts for feature importance.

ðŸ”§ 4. Real-Time Data Integration:

Connecting to live advertising data sources (Google Ads, Facebook Ads API) to provide real-time predictions.

Creating a pipeline to automatically pull in new data and update predictions accordingly.

ðŸ”§ 5. Deploying the Model:

Deploying the model with Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS for accessible web-based prediction services.

Building a robust API to interact with the model from other applications or platforms.

ðŸ”§ 6. Adding More Predictive Features:

Including additional features like seasonality, geographical region, and past sales data to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.

ðŸ”§ 7. Model Explainability:

Adding tools like SHAP or LIME to make model predictions more interpretable and user-friendly.

ðŸ”§ 8. User Authentication and Reports:

Enabling user authentication to provide personalized predictions for different users.

Integrating automated email reports with prediction summaries for businesses and stakeholders.
